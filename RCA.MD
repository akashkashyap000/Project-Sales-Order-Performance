Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Issue 1: Fluctuating Monthly Sales Performance

Observation: Sales show high volatility across months with sudden spikes and drops.

Root Causes:

Seasonal demand variations

Dependency on promotional periods

Inconsistent sales volume across categories

Impact:

Unpredictable revenue planning

Inventory and supply-chain inefficiencies

Actionable Recommendation:

Introduce demand forecasting using historical trends

Plan promotions during low-performing months

Issue 2: Low Profit in Certain Categories/Sub-Categories

Observation: Some sub-categories contribute high sales but low or negative profit.

Root Causes:

High discounting strategies

Increased procurement or logistics costs

Low-margin product mix

Impact:

Reduced overall profit margin

Revenue growth not translating into profit growth

Actionable Recommendation:

Re-evaluate pricing and discount strategies

Optimize cost structure for low-margin products

Issue 3: Regional Sales Concentration

Observation: Sales are concentrated in a few states only.

Root Causes:

Limited regional market penetration

Uneven distribution network

Lack of localized marketing strategies

Impact:

Over-dependence on specific regions

Missed revenue opportunities in other states

Actionable Recommendation:

Expand marketing efforts in mid-performing states

Improve regional supply-chain coverage

Issue 4: Payment Mode Dependency

Observation: Majority of revenue comes from limited payment modes.

Root Causes:

Customer trust and convenience preferences

Limited promotional offers on alternative payment modes

Impact:

Higher transaction costs

Risk exposure if dominant payment mode performance drops

Actionable Recommendation:

Encourage digital payments via offers

Partner with payment providers for incentives
